## To Reproduce
simply have Python3 installed and in the same directory run:

`python3 sat_solver.py --random`
`python3 sat_solver.py --two-clause`
`python3 sat_solver.py --custom-heuristic`

This will print the encoding under `CLAUSES`, all assignments under `ASSIGNMENTS`, a filtered list of only assignments that are True as `ONLY TRUE ASSIGNMENTS`, and the solution to the puzzle under `FISH OWNER INFO`.
